### Project Checkpoint Week 2
- [Ridhima's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/23#issue-915876084): I worked on finishing the filtering process within the projectdata.py. I also created a projectclass.py where I created a Project class that had created the self.filter option as well. I made sure to contribute more with the backend aspect especially dealing with the python end. 
-  [Isai's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/20#issue-909195031): I worked on connecting the HTML to the database prtion, however, I faced the issue of persistent storage, which is the same issue I faced with WASC website. This means the comments were not being stored in a database or some storage mechanism so that when the user refreshes the page it will stay there. I researched various scripts that would solve this issue and found HTML box, which takes care of the persistent storage mechanism. I will have to see if the CSS can be changed or not for this comment feature. 
-  [Sriya's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/15): I worked on the HTML cards and connecting them to the backend projectdata.py file. I added the variables from each project dictionary into the HTML file so that I do not have to hardcode each. I also worked on the backend by helping Ridhima create the Project class and the blueprint app route on projectapp.py. Next week, I will work on the projectdetail.html page and get it up and running. I will also work with Ridhima on getting the images up on the cards.
-  [Grace's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/21): I worked on building a search filter for the project cards. I added javascript in the html and tried to create a function that would search through each key word. My work is still in progress and I am filtering out all the projects. I took a simple example and I added more to the function to allow a search function. I will work this week try and get the search filter up and running.
### Project Checkpoint Week 1
- [Sriya's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/14): I worked on creating the **frontend** for the project menu based on our [project plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CFiTaqvGOJBBHy6SLb8dqiXlm94fUvoZnKz5r99-06Y/edit#slide=id.gd3dc9efc7b_0_107). I utilized **Bootstrap** to create the cards and edited **CSS** to ensure that the cards would be in 4 columns. [Next week](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/16), I will be working with Iniyaa on the frontend and backend of the chat feature. Once the backend of the filtering is near complete (dictionaries are created for each project), I will use a **for loop** to replace the current text for the project name, scrum team, developers, and image, just like Sophie's project so that we can shave off excess HTML & CSS.
- [Iniyaa's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/issues/18): I worked on starting the backend for the chat feature. I used flask forms and the method POST. Currently, it is not connected to a database that will update based on the comments that are submitted - my next goal is to create this database and make sure it updates based on what is input to the website. 
- [Ridhima's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/projects/1#card-62301064): I worked on starting to create the backend for the filter process. I did this by creating a function for each of the projects and then creating unanimous variables under each of the functions. Then I created another function that took those function's attributes and appended them into a common filtering dictionary.
- [Isai's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/projects/1#card-62301760): I worked on the backend for the comment/chat function where users input their opinions of the projects. I used POST to get the user inputs in main.py. In comment.py, I created the function (storecom) that creates a table and stores the values into the database "walrus.db". I called this function in main.py after establishing a connection to the database. Additionally, the user inputs were passed as parameters into the function "storecom". 
- [Grace's Ticket](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_society/projects/1#card-62353746): I worked on both frontend and backend of code. My goal was to create a functional search bar and filter for the user to find specific projects. I wanted the user to type in a project title or team name, so that specific card would pull up. Using html, python and json, I was able to create a functional search bar.
